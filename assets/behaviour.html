                Foxes are omnivores. Their diets are very diverse. Not only do they eat meat, but they also eat fruits and berries. Interesting enough, they also eat insects. The pups rely on their mother's milk like domestic dogs. The bulk of their diet, though, relies heavily on protein like most wild animals. They can eat up to several pounds of food a day. Whatever they don't finish, they bury under the snow or leaves. Foxes that reside near the ocean will also eat fish and crabs.

            <h2>Fox Behaviour</h2>

            <p class="indent">
                Foxes are social creatures. They live in packs like their cousins the wolves. Groups of foxes are called a pack, a leash, a shulk, or an earth. Males are known as dogs, tods, or reynords. Females are called vixens. Their eyes are catlike so this gives them great eyesight. They have excellent hearing. They are very fast creatures. Foxes can run up to 45mph(72km/h). This is as fast as the blackbuck antelope. They are usually monogamous, which means they have one mate for life. They take in nannies to watch the young kind of like betas do in wolf packs. The red fox can make up to 28 different sounds. Foxes are mostly nocturnal. However, it changes on where they live. Red foxes are solitary hunters. Male red foxes make noises that resemble a woman screaming. They do this to warn off competing males. Female red foxes make noises that consist of short, shrill shrieks to attract mates. Gray foxes make dog-like barking noises used for self-defense. Most foxes mate in the winter. Foxes mark their home range and dens with urine and feces. Foxes are very protective over their young. However, they pose no threat to humans. Many foxes have adapted to living with humans like the red foxes.
