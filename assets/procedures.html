            <h2>Procedures When You Come Across a Fox</h2>

            <p class="indent">Foxes have a natural fear of humans. They don't propose a threat to humans. They only become a threat when they become rabid, but it is very rare. Foxes can easily be scared away by loud noises or squirting water at them. Pets should be kept inside if a fox is spotted due to foxes hunt small prey. Foxes may cross your backyard while passing through hunting areas.</p>

            <h3>If a Fox Den is Under Your Porch, Shed, or Deck</h3>

            <p class="indent">If you find a den under your porch, shed, or deck foxes are most likely preparing for the raising of their kits. Consider letting them stay until the young are old enough to leave. If you need them to leave sooner try mild, humane harassment: such as loosely putting mulch or leaves in the den to disturb the residents, place urine soaked kitty litter/sweaty shirt or socks/smelly shoes outside the den, or put shiny balloons around the entrance.</p>
            
            <h3>What to Do If a Fox is Injured and in Need of Assistance</h3>

            <p class="indent">If you see a fox injured, don't approach the fox. Contact your local animal control agency. If they can't help reach out to a wildlife rescue who can come get the fox.</p>
